# auroramaps

This is an open-source version of the OVATION Prime 2010 (OP10) aurora model in python. O

Current status (July 2023): This code is redone for usage at the Austrian Space Weather Office. Upgrade to OP13 is expected to proceed in the next few months.

If you want to use parts of this code for generating results for peer-reviewed scientific publications, please contact me per email (chris.moestl@outlook.com) or via https://twitter.com/chrisoutofspace .

The solar wind input comes either from OMNI2 historic data or from the [PREDSTORM](https://github.com/helioforecast/predstorm) L1 solar wind forecast, which is based on data from the DSCOVR or ACE and STEREO-A spacecraft. The results are plotted with [cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/latest/) on different types of world maps. 

OVATION has been largely rewritten based on [Ovation Pyme](https://github.com/lkilcommons/OvationPyme) and open source versions thankfully made available by NOAA and the UK MetOffice.

## Installation

Install python with miniconda:

on Linux:

    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
    bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
  
on MacOS:

    curl -O https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
    bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

Create a conda environment using the "envs/env_aurora1.yml", and activate the environment:

    conda env create -f envs/env_aurora1.yml
    
    conda activate aurora1

After the installation of the environment, go to a directory of your choice:

    git clone https://github.com/helioforecast/auroramaps


## Usage

Activate the conda environment, and run this file - the input variables are controlled in *input.py* or *input_realtime.py* and can be changed there:

    python aurora.py

For matplotlib backend 'Agg' use this:
    
    python aurora.py --server

For a real time version use this (note the solar wind input file needs to be specified in *input_realtime.py*):

    python aurora.py --real

    
This produces a folder in the results directory named as given in *input.py* or *input_realtime.py* that contains aurora movies (gif, mp4) and frames for the event, and a plot on the Newell coupling. For the animation, it is assumed that ffmpeg (https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) is available in a given directory (to be added to *input.py*).



## Documentation


3 modes are available, selected in input.py

 - 0: uses the real time PREDSTORM solar wind prediction.  
 - 1: uses a local file of the PREDSTORM solar wind output.  
 - 2: for using any interval in the OMNI2 data since 1963.

In mode 2, the OMNI2 data are downloaded automatically from https://spdf.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/data/omni/low_res_omni/omni2_all_years.dat on the first time, and then converted to a pickle for faster processing in new runs. If you want to update the OMNI2 data, just delete both files in "auroramaps/data/omni2/" to force a new download and conversion.

There are 3 types of maps available - a global image of the northern hemisphere and high-resolution maps of Europe and North-America. 
For both maps, flux and probability images can be made, andt here are 3 different background images available (blue marble, VIIRS night band and a topography image).
Control all this with input.py. 

These are samples with blue marble background for the flux map (global polar view) and the probability map (North America and Europe):
