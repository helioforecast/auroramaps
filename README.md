# AURORAMAPS

This is an open-source version of the OVATION Prime 2010 (OP10) aurora model in python.

The solar wind input comes either from OMNI2 historic data or from the PREDSTORM L1 solar wind forecast, which is based on data from the DSCOVR/STEREO-A spacecraft. The results are plotted with cartopy on different types of world maps.

Status: work in progress, July 2019, C. Moestl/IWF-helio 

OVATION has been largely rewritten based on https://github.com/lkilcommons/OvationPyme

Optimization with the numba and multiprocessing packages is implemented.
